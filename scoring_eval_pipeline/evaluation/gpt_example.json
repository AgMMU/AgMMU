The main difference between them is flower color (red, white, several shades of pink, and shades of reddish-purple), though a few may have different mature sizes as well. They were introduced as having more multi-season interest due to the strikingly-colored foliage; some are purported to also have good resistance to powdery mildew and other leaf ailments.
